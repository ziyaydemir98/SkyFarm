# HELPME
This package contains a toon shader inspired by Legend of Zelda. To calculate lighting in shader, we used a common shading model called Blinn-Phong. Toon shading (often called cel shading) is a rendering style designed to make 3D surfaces emulate 2D, flat surfaces. The shader will receive light from a single directional source, and have specular reflections and rim lighting.
